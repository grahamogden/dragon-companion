# Welcome to Dragon Companion!

This is my full-stack project, showcasing:

-   [Laaravel](https://laravel.com/) for the backend
-   [VueJS 3](https://vuejs.org/) for the UI
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
-   [MySQL](https://webpack.js.org/) for the database

This is a roll-playing game companion application that can be used offline alongside your games to help you with various aspects of running the game as a dungeon master or keeping track of your character as a player.

## Installation

1. Download Docker CLI
2. Run `make start_dev` to generate the Docker images, start up the containers and run `npm run dev` to get Vue up and running
